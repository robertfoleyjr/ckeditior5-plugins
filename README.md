# ckeditior5-plugins
An attempt at creating sample code for Ckeditor5 plugins since the official "guide" is really, really lacking.
All examples will be in JavaScript, you know the language that 100% of web developers use. 
And more explicitly I will attemp to document what both the CKeditor and Drupal 
communities appear to have ZERO desire to document. The actual layers of the ckeditor
and Drupal plugin api, input types, and custom module decorations required to
actually create a ckeditor plugin in a Drupal custom module.

BECAUSE write flowerly paragraphs about the "concept" seemse to be in vogue,
and not providing actual working modules and code samples isnt'.
